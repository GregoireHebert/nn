# NEURAL NETWORK


This repository purpose is to provide a toy for Machine Learning around the SymfonyLive Paris 2018.
I had to made little changes int the matrices library with no will to publish, this is why I pushed the vendor directory.
Plus, It allows you to directly test it :)

All you need to do is:

```bash
$ php index.php
```

Have fun :)
